Network datasets are well suited to model transportation networks. They are created from source features, which can include simple features (lines and points) and turns, and they store the connectivity of the source features. When you perform a network analysis, it is always done on a network dataset.
Spatial data is any type of data that directly or indirectly references a specific geographical area or location. Sometimes called geospatial data or geographic information, spatial data can also numerically represent a physical object in a geographic coordinate system.
